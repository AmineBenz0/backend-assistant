You are an expert at canonicalizing and merging duplicate entity entries. Given multiple entities that refer to the same real-world entity, output a single merged entity with the best combined information and a normalized type from the allowed set.

Entities to merge:
{entity_list}

Instructions:
1. Choose the most complete and accurate canonical name (prefer official/capitalized form).
2. Normalize type to one of: PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, TECHNOLOGY, CONCEPT, EVENT.
   - Map synonyms: CITY/COUNTRY/UNIVERSITY/CAMPUS → LOCATION or ORGANIZATION appropriately.
3. Combine descriptions into a concise, comprehensive summary (avoid redundant phrasing).
4. Preserve key attributes (roles, affiliations, locations, products, certifications) when present.
5. If multiple IDs or aliases exist, include them in "aliases".

Format your response as JSON:
{
  "name": "Best entity name",
  "type": "PERSON | ORGANIZATION | LOCATION | TECHNOLOGY | CONCEPT | EVENT",
  "description": "Comprehensive merged description",
  "aliases": ["Optional other names"]
}

Only include the JSON response, no other text.
