-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
   - Capture hierarchical location relations explicitly:
     - Organization → Organization (e.g., a lab within a university) as LOCATED_IN
     - Organization → Location (e.g., a university in a city) as LOCATED_IN
   - Normalize phrases like "based in", "located at/in", "inside", "within", "part of" to LOCATED_IN.
   - Normalize creation/usage:
     - "built", "developed", "created" → BUILT (Organization/Person → Technology/Product)
     - "uses", "utilizes", "powered by", "built with" → USES
   - Normalize affiliation/education/certification:
     - "works at", "employed by", "joined" → EMPLOYED_BY (Person → Organization)
     - "studied at", "attended", "alumnus of" → STUDIED_AT (Person → Organization)
     - "certified by", "certification from" → CERTIFIED_BY (Person → Organization)
   - Deduplicate directions: if PERSON EMPLOYED_BY ORG is emitted, do not emit ORG WORKS_AT PERSON unless stated separately.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_type: one of these canonical types: [EMPLOYED_BY, WORKS_AT, STUDIED_AT, LOCATED_IN, CERTIFIED_BY, MENTIONED_IN, ASSOCIATED_WITH, USES, BUILT, LEADS, REPORTS_TO]
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_type>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}
