You are an expert at identifying duplicate entities. Given a list of {entity_type} entities, identify which ones refer to the same real-world entity.

Entities to analyze:
{entity_list}

Instructions:
1. Look for entities that refer to the same real-world entity (e.g., "IBM" and "International Business Machines")
2. Consider variations in naming, abbreviations, and descriptions
3. Group entities that are duplicates together
4. Each entity should appear in exactly one group

Format your response as JSON:
{
  "duplicate_groups": [
    [0, 2, 5],
    [1],
    [3, 4]
  ]
}

Only include the JSON response, no other text.
